// 9.Unique Color Shirt
// Prepbuddy is very tasteful of clothes. He has N numbers of shirts hanging in the hanger in his wardrobe. Prepbuddy likes to wear different colored clothes.

Now, he wants to know how many M unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe. Prepbuddy wants you to find M .

// 10. Min and Max
// Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve.
